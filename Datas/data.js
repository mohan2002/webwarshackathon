But these websites were mainly providing information.  Some were more visual – a marketing magazine online – but none were interactive.","Interactivity didn’t really start until the pornographers saw the potential of the internet.  As with any new technology, sex and pornography is the catalyst that drives early adoption.  For example, Event Horizons BBS was grossing more than $3.2 million dollars a year by 1993. Jim Maxey, who ran Event Horizons, employed ten people simply to scan photographs, format them, and put them online for download.  They didn’t do any marketing as such, as news got around through word of mouse, and a whole raft of sites launched leading to commerce online.   Unfortunately, it also led to a proliferation of child pornography, previously inaccessible easily.  The NCMEC estimated in 2003 that 20%of all pornography traded online was child pornography, an increase of 1500% in six years.","This was the decade of Web 1.0: the evolution of the first website into 1000s of sites delivering everything from infomercials to easy commerce.  It was the time of Netscape and AOL, of dial-up lines and modems."],

Currently, intelligent algorithms are now embedded in Internet systems and can interpret data and deliver services in a more structured and personalized form for each user. These algorithms analyse users' historical Internet data and use it to improve subsequent Web-browsing experience. Let’s dive into these upgrades and how they affected users.","Many shoppers visit the websites of online shops to make online purchases. If the website recommends another item to you as an item other people bought after buying the original item you had in mind, you just experienced Web 3.0. There are also other instances that an advert pops up while we are surfing the web. If those adverts are about a service in the area you live in, it means that the system has analysed information about you and proposed a service personalised to your location. Machine learning, neural networks, and artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT) etc., are some of the technologies that are characteristic of Web 3.0.","Web 3.0 is driven by protocols that prioritise privacy and decentralisation. Users will have greater control over their data. Coming at around the same time that blockchain and decentralised finance emerged, Web 3.0 supports decentralised applications and smart contracts. In many respects, Web 3.0 is the internet democratised.","The Web 3.0 phase began around 2010 and spans until the current date, but already there are talks of a Web 4.0. This development speed is an indicator of how fast technology can evolve, especially as worldwide access is at its highest point ever seen to this time. While many websites are already running Web 3.0 protocols, some are still stuck in Web 2.0, while others are jumping ahead into a new defining Web 4.0 era, creating a strange divergence between websites and platforms."],

It's built on the concept of edge computing and uses platforms built on top of blockchain, cryptocurrency, NFTs (non-fungible tokens), and other technologies. ","Edge computing allows companies to bring computing as close to the user's device, or another end-point, as possible. This in turn allows new use cases, like self-driving cars that have to make split second decisions about road traffic conditions.","The term Web 3.0 was created in 2014 by Gavin Wood, Ethereum's co-founder, though John Markoff of the New York Times is also credited for coining the term in 2006 at times.","Conceptually, Web 3.0 sounds like a good idea but it is not without issues. Many have called Web 3.0 a solution to Big Tech supremacy, by improving privacy, data security and simplifying scalability.","The emphasis on decentralisation makes web 3.0 difficult to monopolise, at least on paper. While Big Tech firms, including Google, Facebook and more have been able to gain control over the Internet due to their deep integration over the data ecosystem, the philosophy behind Web 3.0 is that no single party should have ownership of data.","Since most things on Web 3.0 will be on blockchains, surely, it is more secure. All exchanges will be in crypto, making the process largely tamper-proof and transparent, at least partially, NFTs will have its role to play with users’ ownership in this universe where everything is expected to function in a metaverse."],
